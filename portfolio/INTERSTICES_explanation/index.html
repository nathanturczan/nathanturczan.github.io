<h1>Two Ensemble Performances Employing the Scale Navigator</h1>

<h2>INTERSTICES</h2>

<p>INTERSTICES is an improvisational piece of networked music composed for the CalArts
Machine Orchestra that premiered December 6th, 2018. Inspired by Terry Reilly’s In
C, the piece is based around the idea of synchronizing a large ensemble of improvisers
over changing scales as controlled by a conductor.</p>


<p>INTERSTICES makes use of the SNLPN to stay in harmonic sync, with a player directing modulation on a global scale using the Scale Navigator in its Conductor capacity.
Other members of the ensemble—playing acoustic instruments or performing with Ableton Live—are updated of scale changes via the Client component, whose screen
score transforms to describe the current selected scale for the acoustic players to sight
read and interpret.1
If the player is performing with an Ableton session, the Client
also sends an index number identifying the current scale to a “Scale Rack” object, controlling every MIDI track within the session and filtering out notes that are foreign to
the current scale. The form of the piece is determined by an animated scrolling score
that plays on a projector screen (Figure 5.2). This score also contained indications for
rehearsal number, tempo, dynamics, density, color, and other miscellaneous expressive
instructions.</p>

<p>INTERSTICES is an improvisational piece of networked
music composed for the CalArts Machine Orchestra that
premiered December 6th, 2018. Inspired by Terry Reilly’s
In C, the piece is based around the idea of a large ensemble
improvising within a single scale, with the added capacity
for a conductor to globally change the scale.
INTERSTICES makes use of the SNLPN to stay in harmonic sync, with a player directing modulation on a global

<p>The piece is an electro-acoustic improvisational chorale for the Chordas vocal ensemble
(SATB), live electronics, and interactive score that premiered December 1st 2018 at
CalArts. It begins in C Diatonic, with each of the four singers responsible for improvising
melody using only two notes of the scale. The author used the Scale Navigator to
determine the next fifteen measures that comprise the form of the piece.</p>

<p>The author created a transformative screen score to cue singers and assist them with each
modulation.1 This screen score is controlled by a conductor, who presses a “Next Measure” button that highlights the current measure and triggers electronic and recorded
sounds in a concurrently running Ableton session.
The author re-titled the piece Heptagrams after changing the harmonic structure of the
piece.</p>
