        <p>I had used the <a href="https://www.nathanturczan.com/apps/">Scale Navigator</a> in a number of musical jam sessions as a way to keep a number of musicians harmonically synchronized: by projecting the selected scale on the wall in standard western notation, the musicians are always aware of what musical key they're in &mdash; and more importantly, when the key changes. I came to think of this notated scale projected on the wall as a <i>realtime score</i>, defined as &ldquo;any notation, either traditional or graphic, which is created or transformed during an actual musical performance&rdquo; <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07494467.2010.509587?scroll=top&needAccess=true">(Clay & Freeman, 2010, p. 1)</a>. I began to devise a system for delivering the realtime scores to multiple web browsers not only for sight-reading instrumentalists to read from, but also to send MIDI and other control data to multiple DAWs on different computers. My goal was to harmonically synchronize an ensemble of both electronic musicians and instrumentalists.</p>

        <p>I call this system the Scale Navigator Live Performance Network, or SNLPN (Figure 1). It consists of:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>a Conductor component &mdash; identical to the Scale Navigator. This is the interface from which a &ldquo;conductor&rdquo; participant selects the scale. It sends scale and MIDI control data to the Server.</li>
          <li>a Server &mdash; a simple node server running on the conductor's computer. It recieves information from the Conductor component and transmits it to the Client component</li>
          <li>a Client component &mdash; a web page open on an ensemble musician's computer (or computers) displaying a realtime score. It recieves scale and MIDI data from the Server.</li>
        </ul>

            </div>
            Figure 2: Client component
        </div>

        <p>This network infrastructure is hierarchical and unidirectional in the traditional Western conductor-musician configuration (Figure 3): the Conductor module sends scale and chord information to the Server via WebSockets. This data is then pushed to the Client component, open in the performers’ browser windows and displaying notation describing the current scale as selected by the Conductor. The Client component (or Client page) is intended for use by both sight-readers and electronic improvisers, and therefore has a button for mapping various streams of incoming control data to parameters in Ableton Live (or similar DAW) (Figure 2).</p>

        <h2>INTERSTICES</h2>

        <p>INTERSTICES is an improvisational piece of networked music composed for the <a href="https://mtiid.calarts.edu/projects/performances/the-machine-orchestra/">CalArts Machine Orchestra</a> that premiered December 6th, 2018. Inspired by Terry Reilly’s In C, the piece is based around the idea of synchronizing a large ensemble of improvisers over changing scales as controlled by a conductor. See Figure 3 for a rehearsal of INTERSTICES:</p>

        <p>INTERSTICES makes use of the SNLPN to stay in harmonic sync, with a player directing modulation on a global scale using the Scale Navigator in its Conductor capacity. Other members of the ensemble—playing acoustic instruments or performing with Ableton Live—are updated of scale changes via the Client component, whose screen score transforms to describe the current selected scale for the acoustic players to sight read and interpret. If the player is performing with an Ableton session, the Client also sends an index number identifying the current scale to a &ldquo;Scale Rack&rdquo; object, controlling every MIDI track within the session and filtering out notes that are foreign to the current scale. The form of the piece is determined by an animated scrolling score that plays on a projector screen (Figure 4). This score also contained indications for rehearsal number, tempo, dynamics, density, color, and other miscellaneous expressive instructions.
