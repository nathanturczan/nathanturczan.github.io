        <p>The piece is an electro-acoustic improvisational chorale for the Chordas vocal ensemble (SATB), live electronics, and interactive score that premiered December 1st 2018 at CalArts. It begins in C Diatonic, with each of the four singers responsible for improvising melody using only two notes of the scale. The author used the Scale Navigator to determine the next fifteen measures that comprise the form of the piece.</p>

        

        <p>The author created a transformative screen score to cue singers and assist them with each modulation.1 This screen score is controlled by a conductor, who presses a “Next Measure” button that highlights the current measure and triggers electronic and recorded sounds in a concurrently running Ableton session. The author re-titled the piece Heptagrams after changing the harmonic structure of the piece.

        <p>Heptagrams is a semi-improvisational piece for four singers, a conductor, and a MIDI-controlled player piano. The singers are assisted in their improvisation by a real time score, defined by Jason Freeman as “any notation, either traditional or graphic, which is created or transformed during an actual musical performance." The conductor triggers transformations in the score, indicating to the singers when to modulate to a new seven-note mode and triggering arpeggiations in the player piano. Heptagrams features sixteen of these modes, all with G as their root, ranging from church modes (Aeolian and Lydian) to equally-tempered versions of Carnatic rāgam (Mela Natakapriya).</p>
