<h1>The Just Man</h1>


<p>INTERSTICES is an improvisational piece of networked
music composed for the CalArts Machine Orchestra that
premiered December 6th, 2018. Inspired by Terry Reilly’s
In C, the piece is based around the idea of a large ensemble
improvising within a single scale, with the added capacity
for a conductor to globally change the scale.
INTERSTICES makes use of the SNLPN to stay in harmonic sync, with a player directing modulation on a global
scale using the Scale Navigator in its Conductor capacity.
Other members of the ensemble—playing acoustic instruments or performing with a Ableton Live—are updated of
scale changes via the Client component, whose screen score
transforms to describe the current selected scale for the
acoustic players to sight read and interpret.6 If the player
is performing with an Ableton session, the Client also sends
an index number identifying the current scale to a “Scale
Rack” object, controlling every MIDI track within the session and filtering out notes that are foreign to the current
scale. The form of the piece is determined by an animated
scrolling score that plays on a projector screen<p>
