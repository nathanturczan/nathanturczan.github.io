<h1>The Just Man</h1>

<p>The Scale Navigator has been proven to aid composers during the pre-compositional phase of writing music. Turczan’s
process for writing Network Impressions relied on the Scale
Navigator to help pre-determine the piece’s blueprint for
modulation. The piece is an electro-acoustic improvisational chorale for the Chordas vocal ensemble (SATB), live
electronics, and interactive score that premiered December
1st, 2018 at CalArts. Begining in C Diatonic, each of the
four singers is responsible for improvising melody using only
two notes of the scale. Turczan used the Scale Navigator to
determine the next fifteen measures of the piece.
Turczan created a transformative screen score (Figure 5)
to cue singers and assist them with each modulation.5 This
screen score is controlled by a conductor, who presses a
“Next Measure” button that highlights the current measure
and triggers electronic and recorded sounds in a concurrently running Ableton session.</p>

<p>INTERSTICES is an improvisational piece of networked
music composed for the CalArts Machine Orchestra that
premiered December 6th, 2018. Inspired by Terry Reilly’s
In C, the piece is based around the idea of a large ensemble
improvising within a single scale, with the added capacity
for a conductor to globally change the scale.
INTERSTICES makes use of the SNLPN to stay in harmonic sync, with a player directing modulation on a global
scale using the Scale Navigator in its Conductor capacity.
Other members of the ensemble—playing acoustic instruments or performing with a Ableton Live—are updated of
scale changes via the Client component, whose screen score
transforms to describe the current selected scale for the
acoustic players to sight read and interpret.6 If the player
is performing with an Ableton session, the Client also sends
an index number identifying the current scale to a “Scale
Rack” object, controlling every MIDI track within the session and filtering out notes that are foreign to the current
scale. The form of the piece is determined by an animated
scrolling score that plays on a projector screen</p>
