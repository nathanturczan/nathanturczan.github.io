<h1>The Scale Navigator</h1>

<p>The Scale Navigator is a graphical interface implementation of some of the ideas I found in Dmitri Tymoczko’s fantastic paper Scale Networks and Debussy.</p>

<p>Tymoczko describes a few different configurations of scale network, but I chose to limit the scope of this particular iteration of the Scale Navigator to just include the 7-note "Pressing" scales: Diatonic, Acoustic, Harmonic Major and Harmonic Minor. Scales are connected if one can be transformed to the other by altering one note by a single semitone. E.g. C Diatonic has six notes in common with G Diatonic, differing by only the semitone between the F and the F♯, respectively. Tymoczko calls this relationship “maximally intersecting voice leading.” Diatonic scales have 6 neighbors, and the other three scale classes all have four.</p>

<p>The Scale Navigator is an interactive visualization of this network: the selected scale is in the center of the interface, radially surrounded by adjacent neighbor scales. Clicking on an adjacent scale (or scalar superset) selects a new scale.</p>

<p>Each scale in the Scale Navigator is represented by a clickable polygonal-shaped node. The scale’s number of adjacent neighbors determines the number of sides its shape has (hexagon = Diatonic because they have 6 locally adjacent neighbors, etc). The root of each scale determines its node’s color (I mapped the color wheel to the 12 chromatic notes arranged in fifths).</p>

<p>For fun, I added a chordal element to the interface: the Scale Navigator’s chord generator draws from a lexicon of jazz chord voicings catalogued in Bill Boyd’s Jazz Chord Progressions. To generate a new chord, the user clicks on the currently selected scale, one of its adjacent scale neighbors, or one of a list of “scalar supersets” found in the upper right of the interface. The chord generated will be a subset of the scale clicked. Go ahead and play with some of the settings on the lower left corner of the screen to get different chordal results!</p>

<p>Future iterations of this project will include not only all Scales of Limited Transposition, but all possible combinations of the equally-tempered 12 notes (Ian Ring has a fantastic write-up found here).</p>

<p>My experience at CalArts culminated with my thesis “The Scale Navigator: A Synesthetic Interface for Manipulating Harmony in Composition, Performance and Installation” where I discuss the design and implementation of my \href{http://www.nathanturczan.com/apps/scale_navigator_HEPTATONIC/}{{\color{blue} Scale Navigator}} software, a multi-modal web app for navigating complex procedurally generated harmony. I later presented this research at the \href{https://mtiid.calarts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Turczan_NIME2019_scalenav.pdf}{{\color{blue} New Interfaces for Musical Expression conference}} in June of 2019. </p>

<p>Dmitri Tymoczko [8] describes a system of interconnected
seven-note scales inclusive of all twelve transpositions of the
Diatonic, Acoustic, Harmonic Major, and Harmonic Minor
scale classes. These forty-eight distinct scales are organized
as nodes of a scale network graph—for the purposes of this
paper, the “scale network” (Figure 1)—where two scales are
connected if one can be transformed to the other by altering
one note by a single semitone. As an example, C Diatonic
has six notes in common with G Diatonic, di↵ering by only
the semi-tone between the F and the F], respectively. Diatonic scales have six neighbors, and the other three scale
classes all have four. This relationship is called “maximally
intersecting voice leading” [8].
Much like the circle of fifths, the described scale network
is a geometric visualization of scalar relationships. The circle of fifths is in fact one possible Diatonic-only pathway
through the scale network, though the structure also contains connections to Acoustic, Harmonic Major and Harmonic Minor. These “synthetic scales” di↵er from the Diatonic scale class by only one note; they are still highly
triadic and familiar.
Tymoczko’s scale network is a framework for diverse approaches to harmony. It can be used to analyze and create
tonal works because it encompasses the circle of fifths. If
one ignores harmonic functionality, one can use the scale
network to find connections to scales that would be impossible to modulate to under the restrictions of tonality. If
one dispenses with triads, the scale network can be used in
conjunction with diatonic set technique or pandiatonicism
to find exciting new chordal possibilities.</p>
