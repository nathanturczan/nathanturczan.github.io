        <h1>Two Interactive Multimedia Installations for the <a href="http://wavecave.calarts.edu/">CalArts WaveCave</a></h1>

        <p>Designing and playing with the <a href="https://www.nathanturczan.com/apps/">Scale Navigator</a> opened up a deep well of ideas to me. One idea that struck me was the power of sensory metaphor: if harmony is an abstract space, what does &ldquo;up&rdquo; sound like? How can shape and color synchronize with sound to create a more seamless, synesthetically unified experience? In 2018 and 2019 I designed two interactive audiovisual installations for the <a href="http://wavecave.calarts.edu/">CalArts WaveCave</a> in an attempt to answer these questions.</p>

        <h2>Modal Intersections</h2>

        <p><i>Modal Intersections</i> was a 2018 interactive audiovisual installation for the <a href="http://wavecave.calarts.edu/">CalArts WaveCave</a> centered around the Scale Navigator as an interface for interaction, allowing a user to explore, play, and otherwise navigate through &ldquo;the abstract, precompositional space within which Debussy’s music moves&rdquo; <a href="https://dmitri.mycpanel.princeton.edu/files/publications/debussy.pdf">(Tymoczko, 2004, p. 247)</a>. The Scale Navigator &mdash; running on Chrome &mdash; was open on an iPad embedded in a podium in the middle of the space (Figure 2) for participants to interact with, triggering melodies and arpeggios in the selected scale on two opposing Yamaha DisKlaviers. Software patches for arpeggiation and melody were designed entirely in Ableton using some recomposed MIDI files and a lot of MIDI effects: the Max4Live MIDI Echo effect was particularly useful for repeating chords, melodies, and other musical figures morph and mold to fit the selected scale.</p>

        <p>Each scale was accompanied by its own looping video of roadway intersections in Los Angeles; scale selection in the Scale Navigator (routed via MIDI to <a href="https://derivative.ca/">TouchDesigner</a>) triggered the footage. This piece exploited the structure of the scale network to create a non-linear film experience. The way each scale was paired with its own video loop was an attempt to associate parallel sensory phenomena: a highway intersection for each harmonic intersection. </p>

        <p>I submit that synesthesia differs from metaphor only in that it is a more persistent association between two or more sensations. However, no two synesthedes agree on which sensory input gets associated with what. The synesthesia underlying Modal Intersections is therefore arbitrary: only in the CalArts WaveCave for one week in October is F Harmonic Major so closely married to footage of a pillar by the 101 freeway.</p>

        <h2>Thought Loops</h2>

        <p><i>Thought Loops</i>, my second stab at a WaveCave installation, was an opportunity to iterate on <i>Modal Intersections</i>. Billed as a &ldquo;non linear poem for voice and accompaniment,&rdquo; it lived in the CalArts WaveCave for one week in January 2019.</p>

        <p>Much like <i>Modal Intersections</i>, users interacted with the Scale Navigator open in an iPad on a podium in the center of the room to navigate through scales. The interface was significantly altered to display no text information whatsoever, and I went with a &ldquo;night mode&rdquo; color scheme to match the dark aesthetic of the room. Each scale was synesthetically associated with one line of a non-linear poem projected on one wall of the WaveCave (Figure 4, right wall). Kayla Pica Pau Marie, a graduate student of the CalArts School of Critical Studies assisted me in coming up with the appropriate tone for the text of <i>Thought Loops</i>. The notated scale was projected onto an adjacent wall for musicians to sight-read (Figure 4, left wall).</p>

        <p>I spent many hours with frequent collaborator <a href="https://www.tannerpfeiffer.com/">Tanner Pfeiffer</a> in the CalArts Radio Station—where there are some decent microphones—recording our voices across a range of an octave and a half, inclusive of four vowel types and three dynamics to create a library of vocal samples to create the sound world for <i>Thought Loops</i>. These vocal samples were triggered by interactions with the Scale Navigator, and played through a quad-speaker setup in the four corners of the room.</p>

        <p>Documentation of live sight-reading experiments with as many as five musicians performing inside the WaveCave during the run of <i>Thought Loops</i>, drawing from the changing scales projected on the wall and improvsing with the vocal soundscapes can be found in the YouTube Playlist in Figure 4.</p>
