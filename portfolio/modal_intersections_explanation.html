<h1>Modal Intersections // Thought Loops</h1>

<p>All of the Scale Navigator’s functionality thus described has
painted a picture of a musical tool that is only for musicians.
This section details author Nathan Turczan’s attempt to
integrate the Scale Navigator into an interactive installation
as an interface for a potential non-musician participant to
direct their own experience.
Modal Intersections was a 2018 interactive audiovisual
installation for the CalArts WaveCave centered around the
Scale Navigator as an interface for interaction, giving the
experience of conductor to a user (Figure 6). The Scale
Navigator—running on Chrome—was open on an iPad embedded in a podium in the middle of the space for participants to interact with, triggering melodies and arpeggios in
the selected scale on two opposing Yamaha DisKlaviers.
Each scale was accompanied by its own looping video of
roadway intersections in Los Angeles; scale selection in the
Scale Navigator (routed via MIDI to TouchDesigner) triggered the footage. This piece exploited the structure of the
scale network to create a non-linear film experience. The
way each scale was paired with its own video loop was an attempt to associate parallel sensory phenomena: a highway
intersection for each harmonic intersection.7</p>

<p>I continually return to the well of ideas that the Scale Navigator has opened to me, namely the power of sensory metaphor. If harmony is an abstract space, what does "up" sound like? How can shape and color synchronize with sound to create a more seamless, synesthetically unified experience? My work as a designer of \href{https://youtu.be/dmfJexDdbV0}{{\color{blue}audiovisual}} \href{https://youtu.be/cziHnAYbMNQ}{{\color{blue}installations}} has proven an effective vehicle for exploring these questions. </p>
